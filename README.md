# FU Roll Enhancements for Project FU
Improves the experience when rolling items in the Project FU system for Foundry VTT.
## Features
### Intelligent Random Auto Targeting
Available targets are derived from the scene and filtered based on rules such as melee attacks not targeting flying or covered creatures, or create a custom Active Effect with the "force-target" status that forces NPCs to target the source of the effect if possible.
